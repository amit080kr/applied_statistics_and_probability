This project involves analyzing various datasets related to kittiwakes, a type of gull, to assist an ornithologist in gaining insights into different aspects of their population, behavior, and breeding patterns. 
The data covers two sub-species of kittiwake (black-legged and red-legged) and includes observations, historical breeding data, measurements of physical traits, and colony location information with environmental covariates. 
Through this analysis, we aim to answer specific research questions posed by the ornithologist, using statistical techniques to explore trends, relationships, and make predictions.

Key Deliverables:

- Exploratory data analysis for kittiwake sightings.
- Hypothesis testing for trends in kittiwake breeding data.
- Visualization and statistical tests for differences in kittiwake measurements.
- Linear models for predicting the number of breeding pairs based on environmental covariates.
- Confidence intervals for predictions based on the selected models.
